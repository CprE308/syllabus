### Aim:
This course is an introduction to the basic principles underlying current operating systems. Operating systems have evolved over a few decades and have led to a few well accepted abstractions. We will study those concepts and how they fit together: the purpose of an operating system, processes and threads, synchronization between multiple processes, process scheduling, deadlocks, the address space concept, virtual memory, file systems, I/O systems, security, and the basics of networking. The corresponding (weekly) labs cover the "practice" portion of the class, where the students are required to write programs which interact with the operating system, and implement simplified versions of some of the OS modules. The labs require a knowledge of the C programming language and a working knowledge of the Linux operating system, which is introduced in the first lab.

### Lectures:
Attendance in the lectures is expected, and we welcome active participation.

Lecture slides can be found: [Lectures](https://github.com/CprE308/lectures).

### Textbook:
The required text for the course is [Modern Operating Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Modern-Operating-Systems-3rd-Edition/dp/0136006639) by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, 3rd Edition, (ISBN 0-13-600663-9).

### Labs:
 - Attendance is compulsory (there is credit for attendance)
 - Lab reports are due the week after the lab, unless otherwise stated.

### Grading:
The tenative grading breakup will be as follows (was changed, see below):

 - Weekly labs (report & attendance): 20%
 - Lab final project: 15%
 - In-class quizzes based on homework: 15%
 - Midterm exams: 15% each
 - Final exam: 20%

### Academic Integrity:
All your work (including the labs) should be done individually unless otherwise specified. You are not allowed to use work done by others, or obtain the answers directly in any form (such as from the web). If you have any questions about what is allowed/not allowed, please contact the instructor or the TAs.

Any cases of cheating will be dealt with the strictest possible measures allowed by the university, please refer to the [university policies on academic dishonesty](http://catalog.iastate.edu/academiclife/#regulationstext).
